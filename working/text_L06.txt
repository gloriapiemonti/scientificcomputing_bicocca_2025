The measurement of the \theta_{13} mixing angle marked the beginning of a new era in the neutrino oscillation field, opening the way to long-baseline experiments capable of probing oscillation probabilities at the percent level and constraining the structure of the neutrino Yukawa sector, leaving only the absolute mass scale of the lightest neutrino undetermined. This realization motivated the development of Superbeam facilities: high-intensity neutrino beams produced by megawatt-class proton accelerators and directed toward massive detectors located hundreds of kilometers away, enabling the neutrino mass ordering measurement and the search for CP violation in the leptonic sector.
Among the next-generation projects, the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) stands out as a flagship program designed to achieve these goals with unprecedented precision. DUNE is a long-baseline experiment that will employ a powerful muon-neutrino (and antineutrino) beam with an average energy of about 3 GeV, produced and monitored at Fermilab. The Near Detector (ND) will measure the unoscillated flux, constraining systematic uncertainties, while the Far Detector (FD), located 1.5 km underground at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in South Dakota, will observe neutrinos after a 1300 km baseline. The FD will consist of four massive Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs), totalling approximately 70 kton.
To validate the experiment's design, the DUNE collaboration operates large-scale prototypes at CERN - the ProtoDUNE detectors - with Horizontal-Drift (HD) and Vertical-Drift (VD) single-phase TPCs. The results of these tests are critical for assessing the performance of the first two FD modules.
Additionally, in late 2022 a new cryogenic facility, the so-called Coldbox, was constructed at the CERN Neutrino Platform to test the vertical-drift X-ARAPUCA modules and their readout electronics. This thesis focuses on the November 2024 Coldbox test campaign, in which I had the opportunity to participate. 
My contributions focused on the various test phases — including installation, commissioning, and data acquisition — as well as on the data analysis of the X-ARAPUCA membrane modules.
