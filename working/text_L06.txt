ABSTRACT

The measurement of the \theta_{13} mixing angle marked the beginning of a new era in the neutrino oscillation field, opening the way to long-baseline experiments capable of probing oscillation probabilities at the percent level and constraining the structure of the neutrino Yukawa sector, leaving only the absolute mass scale of the lightest neutrino undetermined. This realization motivated the development of Superbeam facilities: high-intensity neutrino beams produced by megawatt-class proton accelerators and directed toward massive detectors located hundreds of kilometers away, enabling the neutrino mass ordering measurement and the search for CP violation in the leptonic sector.
Among the next-generation projects, the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) stands out as a flagship program designed to achieve these goals with unprecedented precision. DUNE is a long-baseline experiment that will employ a powerful muon-neutrino (and antineutrino) beam with an average energy of about 3 GeV, produced and monitored at Fermilab. The Near Detector (ND) will measure the unoscillated flux, constraining systematic uncertainties, while the Far Detector (FD), located 1.5 km underground at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in South Dakota, will observe neutrinos after a 1300 km baseline. The FD will consist of four massive Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs), totalling approximately 70 kton.
To validate the experiment's design, the DUNE collaboration operates large-scale prototypes at CERN - the ProtoDUNE detectors - with Horizontal-Drift (HD) and Vertical-Drift (VD) single-phase TPCs. The results of these tests are critical for assessing the performance of the first two FD modules.
Additionally, in late 2022 a new cryogenic facility, the so-called Coldbox, was constructed at the CERN Neutrino Platform to test the vertical-drift X-ARAPUCA modules and their readout electronics. This thesis focuses on the November 2024 Coldbox test campaign, in which I had the opportunity to participate. 
My contributions focused on the various test phases — including installation, commissioning, and data acquisition — as well as on the data analysis of the X-ARAPUCA membrane modules.

The first chapter of the thesis sets the stage by discussing neutrinos in the context of the Standard Model and their role in fundamental physics. It then outlines the principles of neutrino oscillations and reviews the major experimental discoveries that have provided direct evidence of these phenomena.
The second chapter presents a detailed description of the DUNE experiment and its physics program, highlighting the operation of Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) and design features of the first two Far Detector modules.
The third chapter focuses on the Photon Detection System (PDS) of the VD module, the main subject of this work. The PDS provides precise timing ($t_0$) for millimeter-scale vertex reconstruction, improves energy resolution through combined light-charge calorimetry, and serves as a trigger for non-beam neutrino events, including solar, atmospheric, and supernova neutrinos. The chapter also describes my contribution to the November 2024 Coldbox test campaign, where two X-ARAPUCAs were operated in their final configurations to validate the performance under realistic conditions.
Here I describe the analysis technique and summarise the results of the data acquired with the CAEN DT5730SB digitizer.
The fourth chapter briefly introduces the DAPHNE (Detector electronics for Acquiring PHotons from NEutrinos) board, employed during the same Coldbox test as the readout system. It presents the analysis performed with this dataset, together with additional studies, including the evaluation of systematic effects and a dedicated investigation of the DAPHNE self-triggering capability.
Using both the CAEN digitizer and DAPHNE, waveforms were acquired across all channels, and calibration histograms were constructed to verify sensitivity down to the single photo-electron level.
The offline analysis shows consistent results between the two digitizers. Systematic-uncertainty studies confirmed the robustness of the results against variations in fit parameters and data-taking conditions. The large dataset also enabled detailed studies of multiple performance parameters, such as Signal-to-Noise ratio > 4, dynamic range $>1500$ photoelectrons, cross-talk probability < 35% all of which follow expectations and satisfy the DUNE requirements.
